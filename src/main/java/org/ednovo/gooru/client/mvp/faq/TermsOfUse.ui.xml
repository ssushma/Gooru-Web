									<b>You acknowledge and agree that you and Ednovo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.  </b>
									Further, unless both you and Ednovo otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.  If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.

								</span>

								<span class="{res.css.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</u>
									The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("
									<b>AAA</b>
									"
									<b>) </b>
									in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes  (the "
									<b>AAA Rules</b>
									") then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section.  (The AAA Rules are available at 
									<a class="privacyLinkText" href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med" target="_blank">www.adr.org/arb_med</a>
									or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.)  The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

								</span>

								<span class="{res.css.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Arbitration Process</u>
									.  A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.  (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at
									<a class="privacyLinkText" href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</a>
									and a separate form for California residents at 
									<a class="privacyLinkText" href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822</a>
									.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

								</span>

								<span class="{res.css.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</u>
									 Unless you and Ednovo otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Ednovo submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

								</span>

								<span class="{res.css.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Arbitrator’s Decision.</u>
									The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.  The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.  If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.  Ednovo will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.

								</span>

								<span class="{res.css.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Fees.</u>
									Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.  However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Ednovo will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

								</span>

								<span class="{res.css.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Changes.</u>
								Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Ednovo changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to

								<span class="{res.css.policyTextLine}">
									<b>General</b>
								</span>

								<span class="{res.css.policyTextLine}">The failure of Ednovo to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.  The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Ednovo.  Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Use will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Use or otherwise.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Use invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.</span>
