#Landing page Gooru in collection
GL0148=The Blended Learning Model
GL0149=In the blended learning model, teachers utilize learning stations to easily differentiate a lesson.  Students work in small groups and travel to learning stations to complete various tasks set up by the teacher.
GL0150=Create a Gooru collection to engage your students and tier instruction either with different levels or learning styles. Collection narration allows you to provide teacher instruction so that students are well supported while away from the teacher.

GL0151=The Flipped Classroom Model
GL0152=In the flipped classroom model, teachers prepare content for students to view at home. Students then come to class ready to participate in more in-depth learning activities, such as problem-solving tasks or labs.
GL0153=Build a Gooru collection and start with a video - either a video you find on Gooru or a screencast that you make. Add in additional resources - simulations, articles, or games. Share the collection with your students and let them explore the content at their own pace. Learn how to create a collection for the Flipped Classroom model.

GL0154=The Assessments Model
GL0155=Assessments document a student's knowledge and/or skills of a particular concept.
GL0156=Compile questions from Gooru to create concept-aligned quizzes. In addition, blend in Gooru resources to create a new test experience--dynamic assessments that include videos, simulations, and more.

GL0157=The Project-Based Learning Model
GL0158=Project-based learning revolves around complex, real-world problems. In this model, the students become the creators of content. Through the inquiry of project creation and analysis, students collaborate, iterate, and reflect on their learning and findings.
GL0159=By building collections in Gooru, students can take an active role in their own learning!  Students will hone their research skills and tailor their resource selection to optimize peer learning. Student work can then be easily stored within Gooru, creating a digital portfolio of their work as an exemplar for future classes. Learn how to create a collection for the Project-Based Learning model.

GL0160=The Enriched Instruction Model
GL0161=Enriched instruction brings a technological edge to traditional direct instruction. Teachers leverage interactive media, such as videos and simulations, to hook and then guide students through new concepts.
GL0162=If you’re interested in enriching your lessons with multi-media resources, discovering on Gooru is the best place to start.  You can show the resources directly from your Gooru search query or you can string resources together into a collection. Creating a collection of your resources will allow you to show a short video clip followed immediately with an online quiz or an interactive game. Learn how to create a collection for the Enriched Instruction model.

GL3178=e.g. I used this assessment as an opportunity for my students to explore various reasons for the Fall of Rome. They completed a graphic organizer as they worked through this collection and were then accountable to making judgements on which reasons they thought were the most significant and why. It all led up to a Socratic Seminar answering the essential question,"In what ways did the pinnacle and demise of Rome influence European culture and history?"
